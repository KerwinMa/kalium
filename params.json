{"name":"Kalium","tagline":"Java binding to the Networking and Cryptography (NaCl) library with the awesomeness of libsodium","body":"Kalium is a Java binding to [Networking and Cryptography](http://nacl.cr.yp.to/) library by [Daniel J. Bernstein](http://cr.yp.to/djb.html). All the hard work of making a portable NaCl API version was done by [Frank Denis](https://github.com/jedisct1) on [libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium) and kalium was totally inspired by [Tony Arcieri's](https://github.com/tarcieri) work with [RbNaCl](https://github.com/cryptosphere/rbnacl).   \r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n* JDK 6 or [higher](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)\r\n* [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### libsodium\r\n\r\nkalium is implemented using [jnr-ffi](https://github.com/jnr/jnr-ffi) to bind the shared libraries from [libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium). For a more detailed explanation, please refer to [RbNaCl's documentation](https://github.com/cryptosphere/rbnacl/blob/master/README.md).\r\n\r\nOS X users can get libsodium via [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) with: \r\n\r\n    brew install libsodium \r\n\r\n### kalium installation\r\n\r\n    git clone https://github.com/abstractj/kalium && cd kalium\r\n    mvn clean install\r\n    \r\nAdd as a Maven dependency at your project:\r\n\r\n    <dependency>\r\n        <groupId>org.abstractj.kalium</groupId>\r\n        <artifactId>kalium</artifactId>\r\n        <version>0.1.3-SNAPSHOT</version>\r\n        <scope>compile</scope>\r\n    </dependency>\r\n        \r\n    \r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nkalium is a work in progress, feedback, bug reports and patches are always welcome.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
